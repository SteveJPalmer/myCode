# :notes::tangerine: Samples of code I have written... 

Whenever I learn something or uncover a great technique:bulb:, I capture it via either...  
- :pushpin:snippets/templates within my personal code library  
- :clipboard:tech crib-sheets 

*(have literally hundreds of crib-sheets & thousands of code examples across the multitude of technologies I follow*).

 Note: Vast majority of code I have written, remains the intellectial property of clients. 
       These are my personal examples/templates created on my own time over last 24 years!
